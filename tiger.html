      There are two recognized subspecies of tigers; the continental tiger and the Sunda tiger. Tigers are the largest out of all Asian big cats,
      and rely on sight and sound for hunting. They can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at a time, but often consume only around 12 pounds during 
      a meal (they may bury the body of their prey and return to it again when they are hungry to eat more). Tigers typically live in tropical rainforests,
      temperate forests, and grasslands in places including India, Nepal, Russia, and China. They are mostly solitary creatures, and mark their territory
      with things such as urine and scratches on nearby trees.
