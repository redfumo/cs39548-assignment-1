      The flapjack octopus belongs to a unique group of octopi called cirrate octopods. They have a pair of fins that look like small ears,
      which helps them swim. Unlike other octopi, cirrate octopods can't change skin texture or color, so they lack the ability to camoflauge. 
      Instead, they hide in plain sight on the seafloor. Cirrate octopods, which range from yellow to red colors, will appear nearly invisible 
      to other animals because the wavelengths of bright colors don't reach the deep sea. The flapjack octopus eats worms and other invertebrates
      found in the seafloor sediment.
