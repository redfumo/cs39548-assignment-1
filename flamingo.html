      There are six species of flamingoes; four species are located within the Americas and two species are native to Africa, Asia, and Europe. 
      They typically live in lagoons or large, shallow lakes. These bodies of water tend to be too salty for other animals to live in, so the only
      other inhabitants of these lakes include algae and small crustaceans, which flamingoes eat. In fact, flamingoes are not born pink. Instead, 
      their coloring comes from the pigments in the food that they eat, such as shrimp and plankton. The brightness of a flamingo's color depends on
      the amount of pigments they absorb from their food.
