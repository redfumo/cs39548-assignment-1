      Pandas mainly live in temperate forests located within the mountains of southwest China where they spend many hours per day eating bamboo.
      They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it each day (depending on what part of bamboo is being consumed) to avoid starvation. Giant pandas
      have extended wrist bones that they use like a thumb to help them grip food. They are currently in a vulnerable status because only around
      1,800 pandas are left in the wild from human threats; development of roads, dams, and railways prevents pandas from finding new bamboo forests
      or mates, and deforestation also reduces access to food.
